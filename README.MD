# CRUD Employee Management App

## Purpose

    - Strengthen my understanding of asynchrounous API calls
    - Strengthen my understanding of developing a server with the Express JS library
    - Strengthen my understanding of database operations with MongoDB and the Mongoose API

## Technologies used

    - Embedded JavaScript (EJS): I used EJS for the front end of this project because it is fun and not often seen these days. I also did not want the large bundle size that comes with React or Angular because this is supposed to be a simple app. 

    - Express JS: I used this for developing the server because it is well documented and maintained, and makes server setup relatively easy.

    - MongoDB & Mongoose API: MongoDB's BSON notation lends itself very well to JSON documents or templates. Also I chose this because the integration is very easy and user-friendly.
